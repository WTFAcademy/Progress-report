# Progress Summary of WTF Academy Supported by EF ESP

WTF Academy has been a proud recipient of the EF ESP grant since December 2022. With the unwavering support from our contributors, the Ethereum Foundation (special thanks to Yijin Lee, Vanessa Koh), and the wider Ethereum community, we've made significant strides in our objectives over the past six months.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1:
- **Improve wtf.academy frontend.**
    - We have successfully accomplished this milestone, a testament to which can be found at https://wtf.academy.
- **Translate Solidity tutorial material to be bilingual (Chinese-English), partly to aid bridging of China and global dev communities.**
    - Our contributors has translated over 50 chapters of WTF Solidity tutorial materials into English, fostering a more inclusive learning environment for both Chinese and global development communities. Please find the translated content at https://github.com/AmazingAng/WTF-Solidity/blob/main/Languages/en/README.md.

### Milestone 2:
- **Further community reviews and corrections (if any) for >70% of Solidity tutorial chapters.**
    - Surpassing our goal of 70%, we have had more than 95% of our tutorial chapters thoroughly reviewed and corrected by our community members. The reviewed chapters can be seen at https://github.com/AmazingAng/WTF-Solidity/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed.
- **Produce open-sourced video tutorials on Solidity, hosted on Youtube (global audience) and Bilibili (China).**
    - Through the diligent efforts of our community contributors, we have successfully produced over 100 open-sourced video tutorials based on WTF Solidity and WTF Ethers. The tutorials are available on both Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/@01coder30) and Bilibili (https://space.bilibili.com/615957867) for our global and Chinese audiences respectively.

### Milestone 3:
- **Produce further new tutorials and maintain/update existing tutorials on Solidity, Ethers.js, etc.**
    - We have expanded our tutorial content and also diligently updated existing ones. 
        - The [WTF Solidity tutorials](https://github.com/AmazingAng/WTF-Solidity) have grown to over 70 chapters, spanning a wide range of topics. It has garnered around 7.3k stars on GitHub, significantly up from the ~2k stars at the time of our ESP application. 
        - Furthermore, we have updated the [WTF Ethers tutorials](https://github.com/WTFAcademy/WTF-Ethers) to 26 chapters. It now stands as the first Ethers.js tutorial to be updated to ethers v6. These tutorials have been widely recognized, receiving 1.8k stars on GitHub, a considerable increase from the ~500 stars when we submitted our ESP application.
